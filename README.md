Here's a simple weather application using HTML and JavaScript that displays the current temperature and weather description for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API
Replace YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. This example fetches weather data when the user enters a city name and clicks the "Get Weather" button. It displays the temperature in Celsius and a brief weather description.
